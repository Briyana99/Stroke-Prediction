METHODOLOGY INFORMATION:

 TO RUN Final MODEL code:
1) Download DIC.ipynb file from the zip file from Phase 3 folder.
2) Open it from downloads in jupyter.
3) Run the data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis steps file.
4) Due to data imbalance dummy variables were generated in the preprocessed file. The file name is stroke-data-preprocessed available in User Interface folder from Phase3 file.
5) Run the preprocessed file.
6) Model will be able to predict now.

 To run the website:
1) Download Phase 3 folder by extracting the zip file(DIC.zip). It consists of folders named Static – has images used in website, Template folder – has home1.html and result.html And MLapp.py and preprocessed data file.
2) Open User Interface folder in pycharm.
3) Run MLapp.py, a local host will be created in the console.
4) Open the link
5) Enter values in the website. (detailed information regarding value information is mentioned in the website itself to avoid confusion.
6) Submit the form.
7) The result of the prediction with Feedback will be displayed.

 To access the presentation:
1) Open the demo presentation folder in Phase 3 folder.
2) Play the demo_presentation video.

 To access the report and ppt:
1) DIC.ppt and the Final report is inside the Phase 3 folder.

 To access the phase1 code of preprocessing and eda:
1) Open phase1 folder.
2) Open code phase1_code in jupyter.

 To access the phase2 code for model training:
1) Open phase2 folder.
2) Open code phase2_code in jupyter.
